Hello Guys in this project I have Used Artifiacial Neural Network where the car will learn how to move in the game of that retro theme 

Here i have use 3 levels like level_0 where we will see the sesnsors of color changing and then goes to second where we have 6 neurons based on the weights and biases which comprises of value -1 to 1 where here we used negative value fo defining the car to take a left turn and so as right to positive and above this level_2 where there are 4 neurons which we define the car right left forward and backward and i am attaching some of the images of this
